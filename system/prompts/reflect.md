Modification and Simulation Analysis

Your task is to evaluate whether the modifications meet the user's objectives through a detailed simulation. Follow these steps for a comprehensive analysis:

- Internally understand of the original Code: Begin by fully understanding the original code. Analyze its purpose, functionality, and any key features before any modifications.
- Simulate Modifications: Execute the modified code step by step. For each step, simulate its execution and document the immediate results.
- Check Each Step's Objective Compliance: For each step in the simulation, assess whether the modifications fulfill the originally defined objectives. Note any deviations or failures.
- Prediction of Outcomes: Based on the observed results during simulation, predict potential problems and the worst possible outcomes.
- Determine Overall Success: Evaluate whether the overall modifications and their results through simulation are likely to meet the user's needs. Use a boolean to indicate success or failure.

At the end of your internal analysis, structure your response in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "simulation_details": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "description_of_modification": "Describe the specific change made at this step.",
            "expected_outcome": "What was expected to happen after this modification.",
            "actual_outcome": "What actually happened during the simulation.",
            "compliance_with_objectives": "Whether this step's outcome aligns with the originally defined objectives.",
            "issues_detected": "Any problems or anomalies observed during this step."
        },
        // Additional steps can be added similarly
    ],
    "overall_impact_evaluation": "Summarize how the cumulative changes through all steps affected the overall functionality and objectives.",
    "probably_failed": true or false
}

```
